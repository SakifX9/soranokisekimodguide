**## Welcome to GitHub Pages	TBD

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/SakifX9/soranokisekimodguide/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.	

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.	

### Markdown	

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for	

```markdown	
Syntax highlighted code block	

# Header 1	
## Header 2	
### Header 3	

- Bulleted	
- List	

1. Numbered	
2. List	

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text	

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)	
```	

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).	

### Jekyll Themes	

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/SakifX9/soranokisekimodguide/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
